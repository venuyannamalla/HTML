<h1> <strong>jesus</strong></h1>

<blockquote><p>jeusu is a GOD of all .all means everything in the universe like in all things.esus[d] (c. 4 BC – AD 30 or 33), also referred to as Jesus Christ or Jesus of Nazareth (among other names and titles), was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader;[10] he is the central figure of Christianity, the world's largest religion. Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited Messiah (the Christ) prophesied in the Hebrew Bible.

    Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically.[e] Research into the historical Jesus has yielded some uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the New Testament reflects the historical Jesus, as the only detailed records of Jesus' life are contained in the Gospels.[18][f] Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was circumcised, was baptized by John the Baptist, began his own ministry,[10] and was often referred to as "rabbi".[21] Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables, and gathered followers.[22][23] He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities,[24] turned over to the Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Jerusalem.[22] After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the early Christian Church.[25] Accounts of his teachings and life were initially conserved by oral transmission, which was the source of the written Gospels.[26]</p></blockquote>
