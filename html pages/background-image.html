  ho is Jesus? This question has enraged, confounded and</br> 
  delighted people for over 2000 years. It is also the wonderful question </br> 
  at the heart of Christianity – and all of life really. If you’re asking this question,</br> 
   we’d love to help you find out the answer.

  At Norwest Anglican we love to honestly and humbly explore who Jesus is together. </br> 
  Our hope is to be a church committed not to religious traditions but knowing and enjoying Jesus.
  
  Jesus, the Son of God, entered our world that first Christmas on a rescue mission.</br> 
   Christians for </br> 
  millennia have known that God’s response to a broken and rebellious world wasn’t to give us</br> 
   up or cast us aside but to save us.
  
  Jesus is truly human, having experienced a normal birth, childhood and upbringing. </br> 
  He lived with a family in a typical first century Jewish house. At times he felt weary,</br> 
   hungry and thirsty.  He experienced pain and suffering when he was tortured and crucified. </br> 
   He felt a full range of emotions; He was tempted to reject God, but he remained faithful.
  
  And yet, Jesus is also truly God. The eyewitness records of his life tell of his divine power </br> 
  and victory over evil. He healed the sick, loved the broken, taught the truth, forgave sins, </br> 
  
condemned religious hypocrisy, ruled over natural forces and even raised people from the dead.
